.SH NAME
vrms \- report of installed non-free software
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vrms
[\fIOPTION\fR] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is an attempt at creating a "virtual Richard M. Stallman" for
Debian GNU/Linux.
.PP
This program analyzes the currently-installed package list on a Debian 
GNU/Linux system, and reports the non-free packages that are currently 
installed to stdout.
.PP
The packages in the non-free tree have restrictions
on their use and/or distribution which cause them to fail to meet the terms
of the Debian Free Software Guidelines included as part of the Debian Social
Contract.  However, some are sufficiently useful that their presence is often
tolerated by Debian users despite their licensing.
.PP
Richard is the most vocal among us on the issue of software morality, and we
agree with Richard that Debian users should have an easy way to know when they
are running non-free software on their systems.  This program is our attempt
to fill that need.

.SH HISTORY
This program was written by Bdale Garbee and Bill Geddes for the Debian 
GNU/Linux system, in response to an open discussion with Richard Stallman
about the issues surrounding the availability/desirability of the 'non-free' 
package tree in Debian.

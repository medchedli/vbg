Description: virtual Richard M. Stallman
 The vrms program will analyze the set of currently-installed packages
 on a Debian-based system, and report all of the packages from the
 non-free tree which are currently installed.
 .
 Note that vrms is not limited to Debian systems only (which means that
 it also works with Debian-derived distributions such as Ubuntu). It is
 also not limited to Linux-based systems.
 .
 Future versions of vrms will include an option to also display text
 from the public writings of RMS and others that explain why use of each
 of the installed non-free packages might cause moral issues for some in
 the Free Software community.  This functionality is not yet included.

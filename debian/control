Description: virtual Richard M. Stallman
 The vrms program will analyze the set of currently-installed packages
 on a Debian-based system, and report all of the packages from the
 non-free and contrib trees which are currently installed.
 .
 In some cases, the opinions of Richard M. Stallman and the Debian project
 have diverged since this program was originally written.  In such cases, this
 program follows the Debian Free Software Guidelines.
 .
 Note that vrms is not limited to Debian systems only (which means that
 it also works with Debian-derived distributions such as Ubuntu). It is
 also not limited to Linux-based systems.
 .
 Future versions of vrms may include an option to also display text
 from the public writings of RMS and others that explain why use of each
 of the installed non-free packages might cause moral issues for some in
 the Free Software community.  This functionality is not yet included.

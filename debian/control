Description: virtual Richard M. Stallman
 The vrms program will analyze the set of currently-installed packages on a
 Debian GNU/Linux system, and report all of the packages from the non-free
 tree which are currently installed.
 .
 Future versions of vrms will include an option to also display text from the
 public writings of RMS and others that explain why use of each of the 
 installed non-free packages might cause moral issues for some in the Free
 Software community.  This functionality is not yet included.
